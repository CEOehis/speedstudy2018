#Learn to Code HTML & CSS

## Common HTML terms

1. Elements ```<a>```
2. Tags ```<div></div>```
3. Attributes - ```href/id/class```
4. Self-Closing Elements:
<br> <embed> <hr> <img> <input> <link> <meta> <param> <source> <wbr>

## Common CSS Terms

1. Selectors - ```p{....}```
2. Properties 
```
p {
    color: ...;
    font-size: ...;
    } 
```
3. Values
```
 p {
  color: orange;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
* Type selectors- targeting the element type
* Class selectors - targeting based on ```class``` attribute
* ID selectors - targeting only one unique element based on ```id``` attribute

## Referencing CSS
```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
```

## CSS Resets
* CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers. These resets generally involve removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning these values down. Because CSS cascades from top to bottom—more on that soon—our reset needs to be at the very top of our style sheet. Doing so ensures that those styles are read first and that all of the different web browsers are working from a common baseline.
